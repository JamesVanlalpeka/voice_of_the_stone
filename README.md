“Voice of the Stone” is an android application which can be installed on any android device. We used JAVA, XML as our programming language and Firebase as our real-time database, Android Studio as our IDE, and some libraries.



Voice Of The Stone
(Profiling Gravestone using QR Code)

Whether our loved one is buried or cremated, a great deal of care is taken over choosing a fitting memorial for them, whether that be a stone, a photo frame, or some other way to remember them. This might not just include words, but also pictures, and messages. All of these make the memorial relevant and provides comfort.

Over the years people have been using tombstones to write a short message, an epitaph is usually added to a tombstone along with a person's name, birth date, and death date. To overcome the problem of very limited information put on the tombstone, we have developed “Voice Of The Stone”.

In "Voice Of The Stone" the users can create the profile of their deceased loved ones by uploading photos, videos, addresses, short stories, achievements, etc into the application. A QR code will then be generated after creating the profile. QR codes can be placed, engrave, or laser printed into stone memorials onto graves, or even onto a metal plaque and paste onto the grave. In every case, the code is linked directly to the relevant profile of the deceased person, offering the graveyard visitor the opportunity to learn a little more from text, photos, video, etc about the person buried under the stone. A simple QR Scan is all it takes.

The Application is developed using Android Studio 2021.1.1 (Bumblebee), Java 17 as the language, and Firebase CL v9.12.1 as the database. The application can be used by anyone with an Android device anywhere around the world where internet service is available. 
“Voice of the Stone” can provide a further way to help remember, and at the same time, allow others, perhaps even people who never knew the person, in learning a little more about them, and the accomplishments they made in life.
